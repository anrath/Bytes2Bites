---- 

The goal of this project was to investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT at performing analysis on various aspects of a database using Ray - a distributed Python framework for parallel processing. We used the Open Food Facts Data which is a crowd-sourced database created by Stéphane Gigandet in 2012, it currently has over 2 million products listed from over 182 countries. First, we completed our analysis of the dataset without LLM assistance as can be seen in the [Human Analysis folder](/Human%20Analysis/). Then, we performed an end-to-end analysis by providing ChatGPT with prompts to generate code relating to exploratory data analysis, summary statistics, and data visualizations as documented in the [ChatGPT Analysis folder](/ChatGPT%20Analysis/). Finally, we compared ChatGPT’s results to the results of our analysis. In doing so, we hope to highlight both the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT for end-to-end data analyses using Ray.
